# PerfectP2P-frontend-app
Decentralized app without a need for a signaling server. Uses EVM(currently AVAX) contract as a registration and signaling system. Requires Metamask for communications with the blockchain. The EVM contract repository name is PerfectP2P-backend. You can use it to deploy to arbitrary EVM chain.
## How to run
Simply download "dist" folder and open index.html. This is sufficient to run the app.  
## How to connect  
Currently contract is running under the AVAX testnet blockchain so you will need to add AVAX testnet to your Metmask and fill it with the test currency from the faucet.  
The following is a configuration for AVAX testnet:

    Network Name: Avalanche Testnet C-Chain  
    Network URL: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc  
    Chain ID: 43113  
    Currency Symbol: AVAX  
    Block Explorer URL: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/  
    
Faucet link: https://faucet.avax.network/
